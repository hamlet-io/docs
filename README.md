# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```bash
npm start
```

## Build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Update Docusaurus Version

Update package.json to the latest version numbers for both `@docusaurus/core` and `@docusaurus/preset-classic`; then:

```bash
npm install
```

### Test

```bash
npm run localtest
```

## Contribute

1. fork the repository
2. update your changes in a feature branch
3. Push to your fork's origin
4. Create a Pull Request from your Fork to the Upstream master.

```bash
# fork the repository on Github.
# https://github.com/codeontap/hamlet-docs.git

# add your upstream repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/codeontap/hamlet-docs.git

# create your working branch
git checkout -b feature-my-feature-branch

# make your changes / updates / fixes in as many commits as necessary.

# rebase your work into only relevant commit messages
# example: I've made 3 commits, but two of them are fixups.
# git rebase -i HEAD~3
# mark the fixups and save the commits
git rebase -i HEAD~<number of commits since HEAD>

# push your feature branch to your origin (the fork)
git push --set-upstream origin feature-my-feature-branch

# on Github, create a PR from your fork/feature-branch to upstream/master.
# make sure you complete any Issue/PR templates provided.
```

## Production

The production instance of the docs site is hosted on Vercel, do not be confused by the deploy script in package.json. This is not used and is defunct. The publishing to Vercel is directly controlled by changes made to master and picked up by a Vercel app.

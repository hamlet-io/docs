# Engine Release 9.0

## Key Updates

### Removal of bash based client

hamlet started life as a collection of bash scripts with the freemarker template engine handling creating files. Over the years we've evolved the bash scripts into a cli that does still call some of these bash scripts but the main interface has been the cli for a little while now. In this release we have removed the bash scripts that aren't being used by the cli as well as the shim engine in the CLI which allowed you to access the bash scripts directly while still being able to use the engines we have in hamlet.

This shouldn't have an impact on most users of hamlet as most people found the cli the way to go for understanding how to get things going.

Along with that some of the commands in the cli which directly mapped to cli calls have also been removed as they have been replaced by other processes, mostly with the introduction of runbooks.

The following command groups have been removed:

- hamlet release - Has now been replaced with run books

    ```bash
    hamlet release upload-image
    ```

    is now available as a run book. For the aws provider

    ```bash
    hamlet task run-runbook -n management-image_push-runbook -- Tier=app Component=myservice Reference=abc123 DockerImage=myimage:latest
    ```

    Will now push a local docker image tag up to the hamlet registry and update the image reference based on the occurrence details provided

    ```bash
    hamlet release update-build-reference
    ```

    This is completed as part of the runbook above but if you need to manually change the reference when you don't have an image as well

    ```bash
    hamlet task run-book -n management-image_set_reference-runbook -- Tier=app Component=myservice Reference=def456
    ```

    ```bash
    hamlet release transfer-image
    ```

    The transfer process has now been removed. Instead we have added a pull image command which you can use to pull an image locally then push back to another registry

    ```bash
    hamlet task run-runbook -n management-image_pull-runbook -- Tier=app Component=myservice
    ```

    Will pull down the image and provide you with details of the image that you can use to perform a push

- hamlet manage - Has now been replaced with runbooks and the hamlet deploy commands

    ```bash
    hamlet manage stack
    hamlet manage deployment
    ```

    have been replaced with the hamlet deploy run-deployments command

    ```bash
    hamlet manage crypto
    hamlet manage file-crypto
    hamlet manage credential-crypto
    ```

    Have all been replaced with the encrypt and decrypt runbooks

    ```bash
    hamlet task run-runbook -n management-kms_encrypt-runbook -- Value=mysecret
    hamlet task run-runbook -n management-kms_decrypt-runbook -- Value=bXlzZWNyZXQK
    ```

    The value section will support multiline strings so you can cat a file into the value section and it will look after that for you

#### Changes

- remove legacy bash scripts ([#370](https://github.com/hamlet-io/executor-bash/issues/370))

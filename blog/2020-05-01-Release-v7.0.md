Welcome to hamlet! One big part of this release is our rename from codeontap to hamlet. Along with the rename we have also introduced deployment profiles and a new CMDB layout
<!--truncate-->

## hamlet and Code Restructure

CodeOnTap is now hamlet - the new name reflects the idea of building a city from many self-contained hamlets which are the smallest level of development in a city. This also fits with our idea of components and solutions forming your overall product which is part of your tenancy. With the new name we've also give our site a big facelift and merged the documentation into the site as well. Head to [hamlet.io](https://hamlet.io) to check it out.

While everything was moved around, we also took the chance to restructure our code as well. This was mainly to reflect some recent changes (mostly the introduction of multiple providers) but also to reflect some future changes we have on the road map.

The code has been broken up into two key types;

- engine
    The engine is our deployment document generation process which takes your CMDB and turns it into a collection of deployment documents. It is now divided into separate repositories based on providers :-
  - `engine-plugin-aws` provides support for aws deployments
  - `engine-plugin-azure` provides support for azure deployments
  - `engine` provides the core shared provider.

- executor
    Executors are responsible for executing the deployment documents generated by the engine. Each executor implementation has its own repository :-
  - `executor-bash` provides the bash based executor
  - `executor-python` provides the python based executor which currently relies on the bash executor.

:::warning
As a result of the restructure the environment variables which are used to reference a hamlet installation have changed, along with the repositories required for each of the functions.

The two guides below outline the current state and we recommend removing the old codeontap installation once you have migrated

- [Workspace](https://docs.hamlet.io/docs/learn/workspace)

Our new docker images also reflect these changes, and have been renamed to align with the hamlet name. See our [Docker Image Guide](https://github.com/hamlet-io/docker-hamlet/) for more information

## Core Engine Changes

### Deployment Profiles

Deployment profiles provide a convenient way to standardise configuration across all instances of a component. Prior to this release, deployment profiles were always applied AFTER all other configuration.

With this release, deployment profiles can now be applied BEFORE (still referred to as deployment profiles) and AFTER (referred as policy profiles) product specific configuration.

With this arrangement, deployment profiles continue to provide convenient defaults to the solution designer, but now they can be overridden in the product configuration.

On the other hand, policy profiles provide a mechanism for tenant wide policies to be employed.

An example might be where you want to define that all components which support encryption at rest always have the setting enabled.

Let's assume we have the following profile;

```json
{
    "DeploymentProfiles" : {
        "encrypt" : {
            "Modes" : {
                "*" : {
                    "*" : {
                        "Encrypt" : true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This also shows another new deployment profile feature - wild card component type - which will apply the setting across any component type. Previously only the mode supported a wild card type (as shown above).

If applied as a deployment profile, encryption would be turned on if not overridden in the product configuration. On the other hand, if defined as shown below as a policy profile, it would be enforced regardless of the product configuration.

```json
{
    "Tenant": {
        "Id": "msw",
        "Title": "Ministry of Silly Walks",
        "Domain": "msw",
        "Profiles"  : {
            "Policy" : [ "encrypt " ]
        }
    },
}
```

cb556418 - <feature> Permit loading of a dedicated file for profiles (Michael Leditschke)
6a3df258 - <Feature> Component type wildcard support in profiles (#1099) (Michael Leditschke)
```

### CMDB Layout

A new version of the CMDB layout has been added, and will be the default from our next release.

The high level product CMDB structure is now

```plaintext
- config
    - settings
        contains settings for the application

- infrastructure
    - builds
        the build reference registry for each application unit
    - solutions
        contains the solution outlining your deployment

- operations
    - settings
        an alternative settings location generally for sensitive settings

- state
    - stores the state of the deployment ( templates, stack outputs etc.)
        the state of each unit is now stored in its own subtree
```

To start using the new CMDB structure you can set the following environment variables to upgrade your current CMDB

```bash
GENERATION_MAX_CMDB_UPGRADE_VERSION=v2.0.1
GENERATION_MAX_CMDB_CLEANUP_VERSION=v2.0.0
```

The upgrade copies the `solutionsv2` subtree under the `config` directory to the `solutions` directory under the `infrastructure` directory. The cleanup removes the `solutionsv2` directory. If relying on the working directory to determine the product, environment and segment, the application of the upgrade needs to be separate to the application of the cleanup to avoid issues with removing the working directory. With this release, the `infrastructure/solutions` tree should be used if the working directory is being used to provide the product, environment and segment. The change of working directory should be applied, if used, between the upgrade and the cleanup.

CMDB's can also be `pinned` to a specific CMDB version to control automatic upgrades. In your .cmdb file you can add the following

```json
{
  "Pin" : {
    "Upgrade": "v1.3.2",
    "Cleanup": "v1.1.1"
  }
}
```

This will pin the CMDB upgrade process to v1.3.2 and the cleanup version process to v1.1.1

```

### Dynamic CMDB Loading

This release continues the transition to use of dynamically CMDB loading within the hamlet engine as much as possible. All input data is now loaded and validated during the engine's bootstrapping process. StackOutput processing is also handled in the engine so that we can handle multiple stack output formats and control how they work in the engine.

A set of new functions in the freemarker engine also move the loading of the freemarker templates themselves into the engine. This allows for the discovery of templates added by plugins and improves startup performance of the engine significantly.

e4f1368a - <feature> Reference Data Validation (roleyfoley)

```

### Deployment Document Testing

Deployment Document testing allows you to confirm that the deployment documents generated by hamlet match what you expect. You can define a test case in your solution which tests the contents of the documents. For example, you can test that the name of resource matches what you expect or test the value of a specific parameter. This facility is now being used in hamlet development to provide a method of unit testing of the deployment documents that we generate.

To help support testing, we've also introduced the concept of inputsources. The default input source `composite` uses your CMDB to generate a composite blueprint which is then processed to generate your documents. The `mock` input source is a new input source which uses templates in the engine itself ( including plugins ) to generate the blueprint which will be used by the engine to generate deployment documents.

When using the `mock` input source, scenarios give you the ability to load all of our input sources through engine freemarker files.

See the [awstest library](https://github.com/hamlet-io/engine-plugin-aws/tree/master/awstest) as part of our AWS plugin for some examples.

dfa28e4a - <feature>Jenkinsfile for template testing (#1233) (Michael Foley)
```

### Command line updates

The engine now has support for a new output level, the `unitlist`. This provides a list of all the deployment units found in your segment. This is useful in big solutions when you want to know everything that can be deployed.

The provider and resource group inputs allow you to define which provider you want to generate templates for.

4a239232 - <feature> Provider switch (#1017) (Michael Foley)
f4347012 - <feature> Add resource group selection (Michael Leditschke)
```

### Contracts

A `contract` provide a declarative agreement between the engine and the executor to achieve an outcome. This release migrates `genplans` to `generation contracts`, which express the steps the executor should perform to generate the necessary deployment documents for a unit.

A future release will introduce `deployment contracts`, which will express the steps needed to use the deployment documents to perform a deployment of a unit.

```plaintext
97d5101f - <feature> Contract output generation support (#1240) (Michael Foley)
```

### External Integrations

A collection of new components types have been added to support integration with external services which might be managed by 3rd parties or other deployment processes.

- `externalservice` allows you to define a component in your solution which has no deployment but provides attributes to other components. The attributes of the component are defined using the settings process that we use for application settings and you can modify these settings using fragments as well. When another component links to an external service, it can use these attributes as part of its own processing. This component is a more natural alternative to an external link as the settings can easily be shared via conventional links, rather than having to be defined on every instance of the external link.
- `template` allows you to write your own declarative provider templates, such as CloudFormation Templates, which hamlet will treat as a code artefact. In the solution or fragment you can configure the parameters that will be given to the template and also map the template outputs to hamlet stack outputs. This allows you integrate this template within the hamlet solution
- `adaptor` is similar to the template component but instead of using a declarative template the adaptor component allows you to use the fragment template to define a scripted process for configuring an external resource. The adaptor supports the scripts the code unit type which you can use to feed in source code for your adaptor deployment. hamlet will generate a config file which you can use to provide environment contextual information.

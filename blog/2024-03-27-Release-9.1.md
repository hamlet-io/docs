# Engine Release 9.1

Just a small release this time round. Mostly just focusing on some minor features and fixes for the AWS provider.

At this stage we are announcing that hamlet is entering maintenance mode, future development will focus on include specific features as required for our own purposes and fixes that effect deployments.

With the rise in other deployment tools in the world that have a much larger following than us its difficult to keep up, while its not good bye completely, we are heading in for a nap.

## Key Updates

### CDN Alias Configuration

Add explicit host name aliases that will be accepted by the CDN

* (cdn): add support for configuring aliases ([#2128](https://github.com/hamlet-io/engine/issues/2128))
* cdn aliases ([#789](https://github.com/hamlet-io/engine-plugin-aws/issues/789))

### Fixed Subscription Configuration

Specify subscriptions to topics without needing an external link. This makes configuring email, phone and url based subscriptions easier.

* (topic): add fixed subscription config
* (topic): add fixed endpoint subscriptions ([#786](https://github.com/hamlet-io/engine-plugin-aws/issues/786))

### Extended support for S3 Bucket Replication

Updated the IAM role used in S3 bucket replication so that it can also be used by [Batch Replication Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-batch-replication-batch.html). When creating a batch replication job you can use the role that is created by the S3 bucket deployment for replication

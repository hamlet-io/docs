# Engine Release 8.7

This has been a pretty quiet release this round, a few helpful updates with bug fixes taking the front of stage. There is also some initial work in our image management process which will be progressed in our next release and includes using links for image sharing along with a more engine based approach to managing images.

## Key Features

### Extensions for more components

We've found that as solutions grow the need for minor tweaks on components are required. So we have added extensions to more components to allow for updates to resource policies and even the ability to add additional resources to a common component.

* Core - (baseline): add extension support for data ([#2028](https://github.com/hamlet-io/engine/issues/2028))
* Core - add support for topic and queue extensions
* AWS - (baseline): extension and policy support
* AWS - queue topic permission extensions ([#618](https://github.com/hamlet-io/engine-plugin-aws/issues/618))

### Dynamic Value Evaluation

When runbooks were introduced they needed the ability to pass value references between steps. The solution to this was to add support for a format for referencing a dynamic value as part of another string. With this release we have extended this support to all components and introduced the ability to add different dynamic look up sources.

The syntax for a dynamic value is `__<type>:<attribute>:<attribute>__` where type is the dynamic value provider type and a value provider provides attributes that are used in the lookup process.

Dynamic values can be used on any component string properties defined in the solution. They can be combined with other values in the same string as well. So you can have a url formatted like `"https://__attribute:cdn:FQDN__"` and when the dynamic value is replaced it will replace everything between `__` ( included ) with the value that was looked up.

The initial release supports the following dynamic providers

* attribute: look up an attribute of linked component
* setting: use a setting of the component in its env var format
* aws_secret: (AWS only) use CloudFormation Secrets manager integration to provide a secret value to CloudFormation

### Adding more Enable controls across attributes

With support for qualification across the whole solution having the ability to define if something is enabled or not in solution configuration makes it easy to use qualification to control if that setting should be used in each environment. This release has seen the enabled option added to more component configuration options.

## Component Updates

### Lambda

Added support for defining aliases as fixed name references to a given version of a lambda function

### Correspondent

Added support for configuring the channels used by correspondent to communicate with users

### LB

AWS - Added support for using a lambda function as a backend to an application load balancer

The following library of Jenkins pipelines examples illustrate the established best-practice patterns for using hamlet with Jenkins.

## Build

Build Pipelines for creating and testing application artefacts based on application source code.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Single Unit](examples/build/single)     | Single build unit pipeline |
| [Multi Unit](examples/build/multiunit)   | Multi-Unit build pipeline |

## Deploy

Deployment of application artefacts generated by build pipelines into a hamlet product account.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Continuous Deploy](examples/deploy/continuous-deploy) | Continuous deployment pipeline |
| [Promote](examples/deploy/promote-release) | Promote a Release between environments |
| [Prepare](examples/deploy/prepare-release) | Preparation of a promoted Release |
| [Deploy](examples/deploy/deploy-release) | Deployment of a prepared Release |
| [Accept](examples/deploy/accept-release) | Acceptance of a deployed Release|

## Manage

Management tasks against the [Product](../../../../in-depth/foundations/terminology#product). This includes management of underlying infrastructure.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Manage Environment](examples/manage/environment) | Environment-level deployments for a precise scope |

## Utilities

Minor tasks that can either be completed by users or automated to maintain the product deployment.

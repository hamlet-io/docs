title: Bash Executor
---

The bash executor handles the invocation of the hamlet components including the engine, and executing the outputs generated by the engine. It is a collection of bash scripts which source standard library functions and offer user facing interfaces from CLI commands

It is broken into two parts:-

- generation: which manages the CMDB, invoking the engine and executing outputs
- automation: which manages the CMDB itself and provides a standardised approach for CI/CD pipeline integration

## Usage

The bash executor provides the most complete implementation of hamlet execution. It can be called directory and is also used as backend for the [cli](../python_executor/cli).

## Configuration

The executor must be configured to be able to locate the other components. This is done through environment variables.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the hamlet executor. Theses variables are required to run the executor

| Variable                | Value                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AUTOMATION_BASE_DIR     | Full filepath to the root of the hamlet executor's ./automation directory                                    |
| GENERATION_BASE_DIR     | The fully qualified filepath to the executor itself.                                                         |
| GENERATION_DIR          | Fully qualified filepath to the executor's `./cli` directory.                                                |
| GENERATION_ENGINE_DIR   | A fully qualified filepath to a local copy of the hamlet engine core repository.                             |
| GENERATION_PLUGIN_DIRS  | A semicolon delimited list of fully qualified filepaths, each to a local instance of a hamlet plugin.        |

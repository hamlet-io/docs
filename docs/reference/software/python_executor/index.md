The python executor is a Python based command line interface which extends the existing bash executor. The python executor is based on [Click](ttps://click.palletsprojects.com) and uses the bash executor for calls to the hamlet engine and the execution of outputs.

The python executor also has its own features as we work to replace the bash executor with the python based executor

## Installation

The executor is available in pypi as [hamlet](https://pypi.org/project/hamlet/)

## Development

See the [contributing readme](https://github.com/hamlet-io/executor-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on installing locally and making changes to the client

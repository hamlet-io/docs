The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.

* Reference input-data is used to compile all “references” into the global variable  referenceData
* References offer a common structure for defining a new data class in a Solution or Masterdata
* The shared provider defines common “references” across all providers, whilst each plugin provider will define references that are appropriate to only that provider
* For information on different reference types and their structures, see the shared provider “Reference” section (link)

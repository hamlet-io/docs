title: Patterns, Routines, Macros & Functions

:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* This section documents common macros, functions and patterns
* This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but a starting point for understanding the design of common features

## Definitions

### Patterns

* Code practices that are repeated a number of times
* Ensures consistency across Hamlet
* Decrease the amount of learning required as different features share a common implementation approach

### Routines

* Macros that require a specific naming structure and must support a fixed parameter set
* Such macros are not invoked directly, but dynamically after routine names are constructed from other data - commonly command line options
* Includes component state and setup macros
* Routines will be identified as such
  * Their filename, parent directory, macro name and accepted parameters must all be in the format defined
* See the routines page for specific information (link to routines docs)

### Macros

* Freemarker macros, using the square-bracket syntax (link)
* perform a defined action
* they cannot return a result
* Usually macros are `add`, `create`, and `internal` prefixed
* link to the Common Settings, Macros and Functions

### Functions

* Freemarker functions, using the square-bracket syntax (link)
* will perform a defined action
* they **must** return a result
* usually functions are `get`, `format`
* link to the Common Settings, Macros and Functions

### Conventions

* camelCase should be used for all function and macro names

#### Prefixes

* `get`  prefix for all “getter” functions
* `add` prefix for all macros that combine to a global variable
* `format` prefix for all functions that handle data structure rearrangement
  * very commonly used for constructing names, paths etc
* `as` prefix for data type conversion functions
* `internal` these macros are not intended for use outside of the engine

#### Suffixes

* `Mapping` suffix for assignment of configuration

#### Common Parameter Inputs

* where possible, parameter inputs should be selected from the following list.
* this ensures consistency across Hamlet

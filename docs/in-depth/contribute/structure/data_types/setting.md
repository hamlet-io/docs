The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* the Setting input-data type defines the global variable `settingsObject` and its getter/setter macros
* This input-data type implements a mechanism for hamlet users to define scoped configuration that is specific to their needs within their solution
  * The settings are then compiled into a fixed data structure within hamlet where the engine and plugin providers can expect to find it

## Settings.json

* Within a solution, settings.json files enable hamlet users to define the settings for the scope the file exists at
* Settings can then be defined per tier_environment_segment

```json
// example of tree output of a settings.json file in a solution

// exmaple of the JSON structure of that file
```

## Settings Handling

### Names

* Within a solution settings are scoped and when merged into the solution (link to solution docs) will create a complex JSON object of unknown depth
* To simplify accessing Settings, when creating the occurrence (link to docs) the engine will create a flat structure at a known depth
  * The full settings path will be maintained in the JSON Key of the new object
* the example below shows the Settings defined in the above Settings.json and how they will later be exposed in the occurrence

```json
// example of the above Settings.json settings now flattened in the occurrence settings.
```

## Sensitive Settings

## Settings Functions

* Handling input-data that is entirely defined by the end user is complex
* To assist with this, the Setting input-data has a number of helper functions
See the Settings section of the Function index for details (link to “common macros_functions_patterns” index)

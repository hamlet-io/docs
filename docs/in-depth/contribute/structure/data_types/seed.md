The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.

* The Seed is a random string value that is generated within the `baseline` component and stored within the CMDB
  * It is typically used wherever a name is required to be globally unique
  * once it is set and cloud infrastructure deployed with it, the `Seed` should never be updated
  * It can also be used wherever a random, unique value is required by a provider
    * though random, it is not an encrypted value and should be treated accordingly

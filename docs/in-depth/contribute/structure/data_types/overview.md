title: Input-Data Types

:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* The Hamlet engine defines the input data types that are each compiled in order to create a build blueprint (link to blueprint docs)
* Each input data type defines a global variable and associated macros/functions with which all related data will be compiled into at engine runtime
* Utilising these input data type getters/setters allows each provider to implement their own provider-specific configuration requirements yet conform to data structures Hamlet understands

## Data Types vs Data Sources

### Types

* The global types of data that will be compiled to make a blueprint from which all file outputs will be constructed.

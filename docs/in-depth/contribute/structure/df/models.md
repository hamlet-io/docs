The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* a Model is a defined data skeleton used by the hamlet engine to sort configuration into a structure that it can reliably seek and retrieve data from
* Once input-data is sorted into a model, hamlet can reliably retrieve and_or confirm the presence_absence of configuration.

## Context Model / Default Model

* The default deployment framework (link) defines the “context” model
  * also known as the “default” model
* Once compiled the context model represents the provided solution in its current “context” of input-data values
* The default model is defined within the shared provider (link to docs)

### Example

```json
// example of the context model during template generation
```

## Set Context

* SetContext is responsible for instantiating the context model by discovering discovering input data and incorporating it into the context model
* Unlike macros or functions that are invoked with parameters, the context model is defined within its own file - `setContext.ftl`
* Set Context is included by the `bootstrap.ftl` which is used to “bootstrap” the engine at runtime for most activities

* Output types are defined by a deployment-framework
* Each framework must specify a “default” output type, but can include additional types
* the default provider’s default output type is documented here (link)

## Generation Contract Output Type Mappings

* an Output Type is made available to the engine by defining the Generation Contract Output Mappings (link to function definition for addContractGenerationStepOutputMapping)
* this tells the Generation Contract (link) what the output should look like as a result of the contract (link)
* Generation Contract Output mappings consist of the following:
  * provider
  * subset name - if applicable (link to below)
  * output type
  * output format
  * output suffix
* More information can be found in the common macros list (link)

## outputSubset

* subsets are a more specific implementation of an output type
  * they are often directly associated with template passes (link to passes docs)

## outputFormat

* output formats allow the assignment of a specific language format
* this is typically used with the “Script” output type (link)
  * allows the configuration of the particular scripting language to be output

## outputSuffix

* determines the file suffix and filetype of all files created

:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* we have developed a few React components specific to hamlet data
* currently can be found in the hamlet-docs repo under `./src/components`
* the below documents their purpose and usage
* all currently be seen in use on hamlet.io

## Components

### HamletComponents

* Using the `HamletJsonSchema` functions below this Component reads in the publicly published JSONSchema for hamlet component structures
* The Data is then rendered as reference data tables at [hamlet](https://hamlet.io/reference)
* This allows us to use hamlet to define its own JSONSchema for each Component and ensure the documentation is always current

#### Props

* none

### HamletExample

* used within the `HamletComponents` React component above, the `HamletExample` component is a pre-formatted code-block with tabs that presents one or more code examples
* For each JSON code block that is provided to this component, it renders the JSON as the primary tab of a code block, with the same JSON converted to YAML as a secondary tab.
* This allows all hamlet examples to be presented in both formats easily

### HamletJsonSchema

Exported utility functions

### getHamletJsonSchema

* Simple function component that can be used to switch between different schema types
* Specify the type of schema required and its version (incl. latest) and it will return its structure from source.

#### Props

type, version

#### getAsyncComponents

* retrieves the required JSON schema using the above
* Filters out all the non-component schema content

#### getAttributeStructure

* Props: attributes[]
* Processes an array of attributes for a given schema and determines if each of them have children
* returns a list of the attributes now associated with a separate list of their own children
  * these will each become separate tables in the reference data

#### getComponentStructure

* Props: name, attributes, requires as { props }
* Uses the above function components to seperate out an individual hamlet components JSONSchema into individual schemas
  * each Attribute of the component that has children is separated into its own schema
  * There is also a “root” schema for the component

#### getComponentExampleCodeblock

Props: schema

* Uses the generated and restructured component schemas from all the above functions to construct a JSON representation of the hamlet Component as it would appear in a solution.
* Presents the JSON with human-readable notation in place of type-data.

## Links

* provide a link to JSONSchema documentation

## Docusaurus

Using OpenSource documentation framework docusaurus (link)

* We use this for hamlet.io

## What is Docusaurus?

* A React documentation framework useful for displaying application documentation
* It’s pluggable
* Deployable with static-site sites like Netlify and Vercel

## Current Configuration

* Using the default layout plugin for Docusaurus
* Customised the colours through the “infima” CSS styling framework that comes bundled with Docusaurus
* Search indexing is performed by “DocSearch” which is free for OpenSource products

## Customisations

* Custom React Components that read in the published hamlet JSONSchema & render them

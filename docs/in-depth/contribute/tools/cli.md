The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

The Hamlet CLI tool provides a helpful python wrapper around the core Hamlet repositories. Though it can be built from source, it is strongly encouraged to run Hamlet from its container

## Usage

* Container publicly available from docker hub repository - just run `docker run -it --rm hamletio/hamlet:latest`
* More specific uses can be found in
  * the Jenkins section for CI integration
  * The developer environment setup section

## Click Overview

* What Click is
* How the CLI is structured

## CLI Command Reference

Supported Arguments /w available options

```bash
// brief list of available commands
```

* All commands support `--help` flag for more information

## Shortcutting the CLI

* As the CLI is just a wrapper around the bash scripts in the Executor, some features newly implemented there may not yet exist in the CLI
* You can shortcut the CLI by executing the scripts directly with the CLI same arguments / options
  * `${GENERATION_DIR}/createTemplate.sh ... etc`

title: Docker Scripts & Misc Files

:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* The following scripts are used within the multi-stage docker build
* They keep some of the more complex logic out of the Dockerfiles

## azpipelines-agent/start

* installs and configures a self-hosted agent for Azure pipelines
  * [Azure Pipelines Agents - Azure Pipelines | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser#install)

## base/build_hamlet.sh

* builds the core hamlet repositories from source, by:
  * feeds  `./config.json` to `jq` , which it uses to create a new script within the container - `clone.sh`
  * Make the new script executable
  * generate a new `version.json` file by reading from environment variables

## hamlet/shellprompt.sh

* Installs a pre-defined bash prompt
  * will appear for all users

## jenkins-jnlp-agent/jenkins-agent

* bash script that starts up the JNLP agent

```sh
# Usage jenkins-agent.sh [options] -url http://jenkins [SECRET] [AGENT_NAME]
# Optional environment variables :
# * JENKINS_TUNNEL : HOST:PORT for a tunnel to route TCP traffic to jenkins host, when jenkins can't be directly accessed over network
# * JENKINS_URL : alternate jenkins URL
# * JENKINS_SECRET : agent secret, if not set as an argument
# * JENKINS_AGENT_NAME : agent name, if not set as an argument
# * JENKINS_AGENT_WORKDIR : agent work directory, if not set by optional parameter -workDir
# * JENKINS_WEB_SOCKET: true if the connection should be made via WebSocket rather than TCP
# * JENKINS_DIRECT_CONNECTION: Connect directly to this TCP agent port, skipping the HTTP(S) connection parameter download.
#                              Value: "<HOST>:<PORT>"
# * JENKINS_INSTANCE_IDENTITY: The base64 encoded InstanceIdentity byte array of the Jenkins master. When this is set,
#                              the agent skips connecting to an HTTP(S) port for connection info.
# * JENKINS_PROTOCOLS:         Specify the remoting protocols to attempt when instanceIdentity is provided.
```

## jenkins-jnlp-agent/wait-for-it

Evaluates the status of a given TCP host/port and if its busy, waits for it

```bash
Usage:
    $cmdname host:port [-s] [-t timeout] [-- command args]
    -h HOST | --host=HOST       Host or IP under test
    -p PORT | --port=PORT       TCP port under test
                                Alternatively, you specify the host and port as host:port
    -s | --strict               Only execute subcommand if the test succeeds
    -q | --quiet                Don't output any status messages
    -t TIMEOUT | --timeout=TIMEOUT
                                Timeout in seconds, zero for no timeout
    -- COMMAND ARGS             Execute command with args after the test finishes

```

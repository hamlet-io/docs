:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* fragments provide a mechanism for solution designers to interact with the current context model (link to context) during engine runtime of a template pass
* kept within the solution
* they compile at engine runtime into a single routine (link to routine def)
  * the routine initiates the applicable “fragment” from the compiled list based on:
    * the current engine template pass
      * the value of the  `Fragment` attribute (if available) of the current deployment-unit
        * Not all Components offer a `Fragment` attribute,
          * check the reference data for specific component attributes (link)

## Fragment Routine Structure

### Fragment Assignment

```json
// example strucure of a deployment-unit assigned an example fragment called "_exampleFragment"
```

### Fragment File

* Must be defined in a solution (link), within the applicable environment and segment
* Naming convention is `fragment_<name-assigned>.ftl`
  * this is a freemarker filetype
* must contain free marker using the square-bracket syntax (link)
* must **not** initiate the free marker file as would usually be the case
  * do not start the file with `[#FTL]`
* must instead begin with a freemarker `[#case ...]` directive
  * the directives statement must match the assignment name in the solution
* must end in a `[#break]`  free marker directive

#### Example Path

`<exampleProduct>/config/solutionsv2/shared/default/fragment_exampleFragment.ftl`

#### Example Content

```freemarker
[#case "_exampleFragment"]

  [@Settings [{ "example" : "setting" }] /]

  [#break]
```

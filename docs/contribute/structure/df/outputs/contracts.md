## Contracts

* the Hamlet engine generates contracts that outline a series of tasks to perform
* Tasks can be sheduled and ordered through two mechanisms - Stages and Steps

### Contract Stages

* stages group steps and specify how each step is to be executed - either in parallel or serially

### Contract Steps

* A contract step define a task that is to be executed and a collection of parameters to pass to the task executor at runtime

```json
// include basic contract
```

## Contract Implementations

## Generation Contracts

* Generation Contracts are the contract (Link) that define the stages and steps that should be taken by the executor during template generation template pass (link)
* They use the process template pass task type
* Generation Contracts are a subset of the default output type (link)

### Generation Contract Stages

#### Pregeneration

* if a `pregeneration` template generation pass (link) is required, a separate stage is also defined for it  as it must be run after the Generation Contract itself is created, but prior to all template generation passes .
* the `pregeneration` stage also includes a `generation` step, which creates the contract itself that is given to the Executor for action

#### Generation Contract Steps

* Generation Contracts define a step for each subset (link to docs) required during template generation

#### Example Generation Contract

```json
// example generation contract
```

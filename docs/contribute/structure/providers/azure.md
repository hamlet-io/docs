# Azure Deployment Frameworks

# Azure Supported Components

# Azure References
* the Azure provider plugin adds some provider-specific references (link) to the Hamlet engine
*  Additionally Hamlet extends some shared references (link) which are identified in the Reference Data definitions (link)
	* Where the plugin extends an existing reference, the reference is namespaced
```json
// provide example of namespacing an attribute within the solution
```

* Azure defines the following reference data types:

* SkuProfile (link to reference data)
* VMImageProfile


# Utility Script
* Azure provides the Hamlet engine its own Utilities script for use at runtime
* this includes content for working with:
	* Storage Accounts
	* SSH keypair generation
	* Interactions with KeyVault
	* Purging content from the CDN
	* Lambda deployment

# Azure Testing Framework
* the Azure provider plugin is accompanied by a secondary testing provider - `azuretest`
* this provider defines the test cases for the outputs of the primary Azure provider
* CI test definitions can be located in the azure provider plugin at `<plugin-root>/azuretest/scenarios`

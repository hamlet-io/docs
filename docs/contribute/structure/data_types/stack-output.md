title: Stack Outputs
---

:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* stack outputs are the output of a Hamlet deployment
* the outputs for a given cloud provider are captured after the deployment and formatted into a JSON structure defined here.
  * This is then the known state of that component
* stack outputs have two primary purposes
  * to provide a local mechanism to lookup current component states
  * to define that a deploment-unit is deployed
    * If a deployment-unit does not have a stack-output file in the CMDB then it is not considered deployed

* though the name is taken from AWS “stacks” it is applicable to all providers.

## Composite Stack Outputs

* Composite Stack Outputs are a single JSON object comprised of all discovered stack output files
* This object is then queried to retrieve existing values using the function `getExistingReference()`

## Structure

* stack outputs for a given provider must fit into the following JSON structure
* Hamlet then knows how to handle and merge these files
  * though it is up to each provider to handle how to look up and process the original output content

```json
// show the skeleton structure of all stack output files
```

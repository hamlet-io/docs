:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* The blueprint input data type is the composite data from all other input data types at engine runtime

## Structure

* the following is an example of the global blueprint variable

```json
// example skeleton structure of the blueprintObject
```

## vs Build Blueprint

* Though related, the blueprint input data type is separate to that of the Build Blueprint resource as it is only ever a global variable
* See the Build Blueprint docs for more information (link)

## Testing

* the blueprint model enables the unit testing capabilities of the Hamlet engine
* By “mocking” the blueprint with a known configuration, tests can be defined
  * Link to testing section

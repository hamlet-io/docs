:::caution
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
:::

* the definition input-data type implements a global variable (`definitionsObject`) that is used to compile API specification data structures
* This enables the Hamlet engine to read and extend an API specification with settings and configuration defined in other input-data types

## Structure

* the following is an example structure of the definition input-data type

```json
// example of skeleton definitionsObject structure
```

## OpenAPI Extensions

* the hamlet engine is able to extend OpenAPI definitions using values from the context at generation time
* the `createOpenapiExtensions.ftl` file is used during generation time by the executor in order to add additional AWS-specific API extensions to the definition

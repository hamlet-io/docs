title: Getting Started with Hamlet
---

This section walks you through the key feature of hamlet so that you can understand what hamlet does and how it does it

It's broken up into stages which cover different topics based around the deployment of the hello application. A container based API with a single page application that says hello from various locations.

The guide uses Amazon Web Services as the cloud provider and running the guide will incur charges on your AWS account. We will let you know in each topic if new services are being used so you can keep track of what has been deployed.

We recommend that you follow through the guide in order but we also include a catch up under each of the stages if you find a topic that your really want to dive into.
